# CNN-models-for-Image-Classification

The UVA Grounds is known for its Jeffersonian architecture and place in U.S. history as a model for college and university campuses throughout the country. Throughout its history, the University of Virginia has won praises for its unique Jeffersonian architecture.

In this project I am building an image recognition system to classify different buildlings/landmarks on Grounds.

I have used following pretrained CNN models to achieve accuracy upto 82%
- LeNet
- VGG16
- ResNet18
